Data Types in JavaScript
Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories:
1.primitive (or primary):-
--------------------------
String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.


String:-
--------
The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters).

Number:-
---------
The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation

Boolean:-
---------
The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false.
It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false).

2.composite (or reference):
---------------------------
	Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types.


3.special data types.
